Motivation & Goals
	Jacob - Test out the Leap Motion and build a robot arm, etc
	
Design Specifications
	Track a hand w/o a mechanical interface
	4 degrees of freedom to mimic the motion of an arm
	Wireless communication
	
Demo

Analysis - Results/Accuracy/Performance
	Wireless performance issues
	Delay issues	
		For a large distance over a short time, there is a delay of about 3/4 of a second.
	Mechanical issues
		Limitation of motors
			Jitter due to resolution
			Strength of motors
		Need to attach the robot to the ground
		Structure of the arm
			Weak materials
			No bearings
			Weight of the materials

Future Work
	Better actuators, stiffer structure
	Direct sensing with fewer intermediaries
	Gripper, more degrees of freedom
	More specific use cases
